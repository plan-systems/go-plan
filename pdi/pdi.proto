    EntryCrypt is the "wire" format for PLAN's Persistent Data Interface (PDI) entries.  It contains zero revealing information and
    is what's sent to/from community data store replciators, such as NEM, DFINITY, and Ethereum.

    An encrypted PDI entry has two segments, its header and body segment.  The header, EntryHeader, is "community-private",
    meaning that it is encrypted using one of the community's shared symmetric keys.  The entry's body is either also community-private
    (encrypted with the same community key as EntryHeader), or it is encrypted using the key referenced by body_key_id.

    When a entry is authored, it is intended to be posted to the channel specified by EntryHeader.channel_id.  The current rev of that
    channel is also listed so that pdi nodes know which channel access rev to use when checking permissions.  

    And awaaaaay we go!

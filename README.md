Welcome to PLAN!

PLAN is a secure, all-in-one communications and logistics planning tool for individuals and organizations.
It is intended to be an instrument of productivity, vision, and self-reliance.

All the parts of PLAN are free and open-source (GPLv3), and each component and layer is intended to be "pluggable"
or otherwise an embodiment of an open-protocol.  The design principles of PLAN are similar and consistent with
Tim Berners-Lee's design and implementation of http.

go-plan is the benchmark implementation of PLAN's p2p client-serving node.

Universe willing, may PLAN empower organizations and individuals with little or no resources
to communicate and self-organize intuitively and reliably.

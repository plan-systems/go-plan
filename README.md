[PLAN](http://plan-systems.org) is a free multi-purpose communications and logistics planning tool for organizations and communities. To better understand PLAN and the role of `go-plan`, see the [Design & Engineering Docs](https://github.com/plan-systems/design-docs).


## About

`go-plan` is the official reference implementation of PLAN's peer-to-peer backend daemon/node.  Dubbed "pnode", its primary functions are to:
- Securely replicate community data with other community nodes
- Provide "serverless" scalable bandwidth and storage for PLAN communities
- Securely host the [plan-unity](https://github.com/plan-systems/plan-unity) clients of community members

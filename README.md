[PLAN](http://plan-systems.org) is a free and open platform for groups to securely communicate, collaborate, and coordinate projects and activities. 

## About

This repo contains PLAN's backend infrastrcuture that ultimately hosts [plan-unity](https://github.com/plan-systems/plan-unity) clients.  Since PLAN uses open standards, protocols, and data structures, other implementations may someday also exist, so `go-plan` is regarded as the official reference implementation.

The [PLAN Design & Engineering Docs](https://github.com/plan-systems/design-docs) lay out PLAN's architecture in detail.

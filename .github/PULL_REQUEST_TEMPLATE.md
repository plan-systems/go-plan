Thanks for contributing to plan-core! Please include with your pull request:

- A description of what you did for the changelog
- An explanation of why plan-core needs this change
- How to verify that it works (most PRs need tests!)
- A link to the GitHub issue that it addresses

If you're contributing a new feature, it's usually better to open an issue to discuss the feature rather than open a pull request unless the feature is trivial.
